# 💳 Credit Card Analysis Dashboard

This project is a **Credit Card Analysis Dashboard** developed using **Power BI** and **SQL**. It provides meaningful insights into customer transactions and behavior, helping stakeholders track trends and performance over time.

## 📌 Overview

The project focuses on analyzing credit card data by leveraging SQL for data processing and Power BI for interactive visualization. It is designed to generate **weekly insights** and allows for **automated data refresh** to ensure the most up-to-date analytics.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL Server** – Data storage and preprocessing  
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – For calculated metrics and measures

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Import**  
   Raw data was uploaded to SQL Server for structured storage and access.

2. **Data Processing**  
   SQL queries were used to clean and transform the data, and DAX was applied in Power BI for calculated insights.

3. **Dashboard Creation**  
   Two separate dashboards were created in Power BI:
   - **📊 Transaction Dashboard**: Tracks revenue, interest, transaction volume, card usage, and state-wise contribution.
   - **👥 Customer Dashboard**: Analyzes customer demographics, activation rates, delinquency, and engagement metrics.

4. **Weekly Insights with Auto Refresh**  
   The dashboards are configured to provide **weekly insights** and support **scheduled data refreshes**, so the latest data is always reflected.

## 📷 Sample Insights

- Overall revenue and transaction trends  
- Gender-wise revenue contribution  
- State-wise transaction distribution  
- Activation and delinquency rates  
- Card type performance (e.g., Blue & Silver cards)


## 🚀 Future Improvements
